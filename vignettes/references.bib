while keeping the experiment fairly balanced. Extensions of the biased coin design have been proposed by several researchers who have focused mainly on the large sample properties of their designs. 
We modify Efron's procedure by introducing an adjustable biased coin design, which is more flexible than his. We compare it with other existing coin designs; in terms of balance and lack of predictability, 
its performance for small samples appears in many cases to be an improvement with respect to the other sequential randomized allocation procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {Efron's biased coin design (BCD) is a well-known randomization technique that helps neutralize selection bias, while keeping the experiment fairly balanced for every sample size. Several extensions of this rule have been proposed, and their properties were analyzed from an asymptotic viewpoint and compared via simulations in a finite setup. The aim of this paper is to push forward these comparisons by taking also into account the adjustable BCD, which is never considered up to now. Firstly, we show that the adjustable BCD performs better than Efron's coin with respect to both loss of precision and randomness. Moreover, the adjustable BCD is always more balanced than the other coins and, only for some sample sizes, slightly more predictable. Therefore, we suggest the dominant BCD, namely a new and flexible class of procedures that can change the allocation rule step by step in order to ensure very good performance in terms of both balance and selection bias for any sample size. Our simulations demonstrate that the dominant BCD is more balanced and, at the same time, less or equally predictable than Atkinson's optimum BCD. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

properties of the rules fall into three clear categories. A Bayesian rule
is shown to have appealing properties; at the cost of slight imbalance,

  Abstract                 = {The interpretation of between-group comparisons is facilitated by the creation of treatment groups that are similar to each other in baseline composition. To prevent treatment effects from being confounded with time effects, most trials use restricted randomization to force balance. An unintended consequence of these restrictions is that they create patterns that allow for the prediction of future treatment allocations, and hence selection bias, especially in unmasked trials. In fact, the more restrictive the allocation procedure, the greater the potential for selection bias. It was decided, in the context of a recent clinical trial comparing two dosing schedules of paclitaxel and carboplatin for advanced stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer, that the randomized block procedure could not simultaneously protect sufficiently against both selection and chronological bias. In this paper we detail our development of the maximal procedure. The maximal procedure takes as input the extent of chronological bias allowed by the randomized block procedure, then matches it, but does so with fewer restrictions. This feature makes the maximal procedure more resistant to selection bias than the randomized block procedure is. Published in 2003 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The design synthesizes Efron's pioneering work on biased coin design (1971) and Soares and Wu's big stick design(1983). The underlying structure of the design is a Markov chain. An explicit formula of the high-order transition probabilities of the chain is obtained. This paper applies the formula to give exact assessments of randomness, balance, and the trade-off between them under the design},

For this design, data analysis based upon finite model randomization theory is formulated. A normal theory approximation of the exact randomization distribution is also proposed. Finally, the validity of this analysis is contrasted with that of a data analysis, apparently in common use, which ignores the periodic balance in the design.},

In this paper, we present RARtool, a user interface software developed in MATLAB for designing response-adaptive randomized comparative clinical trials with censored time-to-event outcomes. The RARtool software can compute different types of optimal treatment allocation designs, and it can simulate response-adaptive randomization procedures targeting selected optimal allocations. Through simulations, an investigator can assess design characteristics under a variety of experimental scenarios and select the best procedure for practical implementation. We illustrate the utility of our RARtool software by redesigning a survival trial from the literature.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper presents a new class of designs (Big Stick Designs) for sequentially assigning experimental units to treatments, when only the time covariate is considered. By prescribing the degree of imbalance which the experimenters can tolerate, complete randomization is used as long as the imbalance of the treatment allocation does not exceed the prescribed value. Once it reaches the value, a deterministic assignment is made to lower the imbalance. Such designs can be easily implemented with no programming and little personnel support. They compare favorably with the Biased Coin Designs, the Permuted Black Designs, and the Urn Designs, as far as the accidental bias and selection bias are concerned. Generalizations of these designs are considered to achieve various purposes, e.g., avoidance of deterministic assignments, early balance, etc. },

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate and develop methods
for analysis of multi-center randomized clinical trials which only rely
on the randomization process as a basis of inference. Our motivation
is prompted by the fact that most current statistical procedures used
in the analysis of randomized multi-center studies are model based.
The randomization feature of the trials is usually ignored. An important
characteristic of model based analysis is that it is straightforward
to model covariates. Nevertheless, in nearly all model based analyses,
the effects due to different centers and, in general, the design of the
clinical trials are ignored. An alternative to a model based analysis is
to have analyses guided by the design of the trial. Our development
of design based methods allows the incorporation of centers as well as
other features of the trial design. The methods make use of conditioning
on the ancillary statistics in the sample space generated by the
randomization process. We have investigated the power of the methods
and have found that, in the presence of center variation, there is
a significant increase in power. The methods have been extended to
group sequential trials with similar increases in power.},
